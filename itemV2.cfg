description = "Infinity ammo without having to reload.  Effectively gives Huntsman's free shot buff constantly, so won't work with bows.

Every player who wants the buff needs to have the mod installed.

Don't use it with overheat weapons (Sienna's staves/Bardin's drakefire etc), it'll crash the game.

Would recommend the No Wobble Mod.
